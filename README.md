## What the heck is Dada?

Dada is a thought experiment. What if we were making a language like Rust, but one that was meant to feel more like Java or JavaScript, and less like C++? One that didn't aspire to being used in kernels or tiny embedded devices and was willing to require a minimal runtime. What might that look like?

## To try it yourself...

As of right now, Dada doesn't really exist, though we have some experimental prototypes. If you'd like to learn more...

* Visit [dada-lang.org](https://dada-lang.org) and read the [tutorial](https://dada-lang.org/dyn_tutorial.html) -- this will give you an idea what we're shooting for.
* On the web, visit https://dada-lang.org/playground to see how things work today.
* On your own computer, clone this repository and do `cargo dada run dada_tests/hello_world.dada` (requires [Rust and Cargo to be installed](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html)).
