Dada is pretty young and informal, but we welcome contributions! 

Keep in mind that Dada is my "spare time, relaxation and exploration" project. Responses may be slow and I am driving the language direction, syntax, and semantics. Naturally I would absolutely love to hear what people think, but I am acting as BDFL and final decision maker for the time being. --nikomatsakis

## Finding an issue

Issues on the repository that are tagged with "good first issue' and the like are a good bet.

## Review policy

Anyone is welcome to review using the github review tool. Best practice is to get PRs reviewed by others.

**To merge a PR, do NOT use the merge button.** Instead use `bors r+`. Bors only accepts commands from the dadaists team (see below).

Naturally one should only approve PRs if you have thorough knowledge of the relevant code and are confident the code is correct.

**Furthermore, anything which changes the syntax/semantics of Dada is some notable way needs approval from the BDFL.**

## The dadaists team

The dadaists team consists of recognized contributors. For the time being, since we are so young, anyone with a merged PR will be offered membership, but you should only accept if you are expecting to continue contributing.  As the project grows, we will revisit the criteria for membership.

Membership in the dadaists team gives the ability to approve PRs, adjust labels, and so forth.

## BDFL and decision making

Decision making strives to be by consensus. Please voice your opinion, keeping in mind the code-of-conduct

For the time being, nikomatsakis is BDFL and has final say whenever anything gets controversial.
