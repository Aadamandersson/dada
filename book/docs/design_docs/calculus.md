# Dada: the calculus

## Repository

You will find the Dada model in the [dada-lang/dada-model] repository. The model is implemented in [PLT Redex], which is a fantastic tool for exploring type systems and operational semantics. This section is meant to explain how it works, but I've not written it yet!

## Current status

* Working on the operational semantics, which I believe to be "getting close".
* The static type system is on hold while those are finalized.
    * There is a complete (but no doubt unsound) working type system model, but it targets an older version of Dada.
