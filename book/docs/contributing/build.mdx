# How to build Dada

## Building Dada as a standalone executable

You can build Dada just like any other Rust project:

* Install Rust via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) (note that Dada uses the nightly toolchain)
* Checkout dada from github
* Run tests `cargo test`

You can also use the `cargo dada` subcommand:

* Run tests: `cargo dada test` or `cargo dada test --bless`
* Run an individual file: `cargo dada run file.rs`

## Building the website

The Dada website is a docusaurus project.

### Installation

* Install node.js, we recommend [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
    * You want the version of node found in `.nvmrc`
    * With nvm, just use `nvm install` to get the correct version of node
* Run `cargo xtask deploy`
    * This will compile Dada with webassembly and build a static copy of the site
* To test the site locally:
    * You must first run `cargo xtask deploy` to build the webassembly package
    * You can then `cd book` and run `npm start`
