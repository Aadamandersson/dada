## What the heck is Dada?

Dada is a a thought experiment: what if we were making a language like Rust, but one that was meant to feel more like Java or JavaScript, and less like C++? One didn't aspire to being used in kernels or tiny embedded devices and was willing to require a minimal runtime.

## Where is Dada going?

This page is about a thought experiment, the programming language Dada. 

## Dada's origins

Dada is derived from the ideas in Lark, which was in turn derived from the ideas in Rust (and many other places besides). Dada is an attempt to imagine "What might Rust be if it wasn't trying to expose all system capabilities or cover every niche?"

## Important caveat

Dada, at this moment, does not exist. It's a thought experiment. It might be fun to build it, though!

## Radically incomplete work in progress

This book in particular is just a total work in progress. It's probably woefully inconsistent. Don't read it.
