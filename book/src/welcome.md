# Welcome

This page is about the programming language Dada. Dada is derived from the ideas in Lark, which was in turn derived from the ideas in Rust (and many other places besides). Dada is an attempt to imagine "What might Rust be if it wasn't trying to expose all system capabilities or cover every niche?"

## Important caveat

Dada, at this moment, does not exist. It's a thought experiment. It might be fun to build it, though!
