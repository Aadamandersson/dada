# Tutorial structure

This page documents the concepts introduced by the tutorial(s) and in what order. This both gives an overview of their content and helps think about how one can learn Dada in a structured fashion. The tutorials are not fully synchronized with this yet, so there are "checkmarks" to track progress.

There are also future hypothetical tutorials that kind of chart out the general idea.
