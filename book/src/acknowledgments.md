# Acknowledgments

Dada is designed by [nikomatsakis], but it's heavily on ideas from [Lark], which was a joint project by [nikomatsakis], [wycats], and [jonathandturner]. Other people worth thanking:

I'd also like to thank carllerche, shanemccrary, and aturon for recent conversations. --nikomatsakis
