# Acknowledgments

Dada is designed by [nikomatsakis], but heavily based on ideas from [Lark], which was a joint project by [nikomatsakis], [wycats], and [JT]. Thanks to [Lionel Parreaux] for his work on [Seagl], which resembles Dada in some ways, and to [aturon], [carllerche] and [shanemccrary] for recent brainstorming and conversations.
