# Acknowledgments

Dada is designed by [nikomatsakis], but heavily based on ideas from [Lark], which was a joint project by [nikomatsakis], [wycats], and [JT]. Thanks to [aturon], [carllerche] and [shanemccrary] for recent brainstorming and conversations.

I also want to highlight [Lionel Parreaux]'s work on [Seagl]. It has a lot of similarities to Dada's leases and Polonius's origins. Parreaux described it to me many years ago and I didn't fully appreciate the power of this direction at the time. Cool stuff. --nikomatsakis
